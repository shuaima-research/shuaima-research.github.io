## Research Overview

My research interests lie at the intersection of **urban planning, housing and real estate economics, climate resilience, and artificial intelligence**.

I am particularly interested in developing **interpretable and policy-relevant machine-learning models** that can inform public investment and planning decisions.

## Urban Development & Planning

I study how urban form, land-use regulation, and infrastructure investment influence long-term urban resilience and social equity.

Key themes include:
- Urban spatial structure and risk exposure  
- Planning institutions and policy constraints  
- Climate adaptation in metropolitan regions  

## Housing & Real Estate

My work explores housing affordability and real estate dynamics under climate and economic uncertainty.

Key topics:
- Housing supply constraints and zoning  
- Climate risk pricing in real estate markets  
- Housing policy evaluation  

## AI & Machine Learning Methods

Methodologically, I focus on:
- Interpretable machine-learning models  
- Equity-aware and fairness-constrained modeling  
- Spatial and temporal prediction  

with an emphasis on **translating model insights into actionable policy rules**.
